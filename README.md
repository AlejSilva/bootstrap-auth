# React Bootstrap Authentication with Firebase and Google Authentication

This is a simple authentication app built using React, React Bootstrap, Firebase Authentication, and Google Sign-In. The app allows users to create an account, log in using email and password, or log in with Google. It also includes protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.

## Features

- User Registration: New users can create an account by providing their email and password. Firebase Authentication securely stores user credentials.

- Email and Password Login: Registered users can log in with their email and password.

- Google Sign-In: Users can also choose to log in using their Google account, thanks to React Google Sign-In integration.

- Protected Routes: Certain routes in the app are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page.
